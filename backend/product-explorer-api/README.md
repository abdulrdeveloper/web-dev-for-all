# Products Explorer 🚀

A simple product listing app built with React. Click a button to see random products with smooth animations!

## What You'll Learn 📚

- **React Hooks** — useState, useEffect, event handling
- **API Calls** — Fetching data with async/await
- **Image Loading** — Making sure content loads before showing it
- **Responsive Design** — Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **CSS Animations** — Gradients, hover effects, smooth transitions

## Quick Start 🏃

```bash
# 1. Install packages
npm install

# 2. Run the app
npm run dev

# 3. Open browser → http://localhost:5173
```

## How It Works 🔧

1. App loads → Fetches random product
2. Image loads → Button appears
3. Click button → Gets next product
4. Repeat!

**The Code Magic:**
- `useState` tracks product data and image loading state
- `useEffect` fetches product when component loads
- Image `onLoad` event shows the button
- Each click resets the state and fetches a new product
