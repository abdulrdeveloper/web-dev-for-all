# Topic 13: Technical SEO & Technical SEO Audit

## 1. What is Technical SEO?
Think of Technical SEO as the foundation of a house. It's the behind-the-scenes coding and server settings that make it easy for Google to find, understand, and save your website. It has nothing to do with how pretty your site looks or what you write. 

If your technical foundation is broken, even the best content in the world will not rank!

## 2. Key Elements of Technical SEO
These are the main technical factors you must fix on your site:

1.  **Website Speed:** A slow site will not rank. Search engines want pages to load within 2-3 seconds.
    * *Consequence:* High bounce rate (users immediately leaving), resulting in a massive ranking drop.
2.  **Core Web Vitals:** Google's specific user experience tests (loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability).
    * *Consequence:* Failing these metrics directly hurts your chances of ranking on page one.
3.  **Mobile-Friendliness:** Most users search on their phones. Your site must look and work perfectly on mobile screens.
    * *Consequence:* Google uses "Mobile-First Indexing"—if your mobile site is bad, you will not rank on desktop either.
4.  **SSL Certificate (HTTPS):** Google heavily favors secure sites. 
    * *Consequence:* If your site URL shows "Not Secure" (HTTP instead of HTTPS), both users and Google will not trust it.
5.  **XML Sitemap:** A roadmap of your website that lists every single page.
    * *Consequence:* Without it, Google might taking a long time to discover your new pages, or might miss them completely.
6.  **Robots.txt File:** A text file placed in your server telling search engine bots which pages they *can* crawl and which ones they *should ignore* (like admin login pages).
    * *Consequence:* You might accidentally block Google from crawling your site, removing you from search results completely.
7.  **Canonical Tags:** Special HTML tags that tell Google which version of a URL is the "master" or main copy.
    * *Consequence:* If you have similar pages, Google might penalize you for "duplicate content." Canonical tags prevent this.
8.  **Fixing 404 Errors & Broken Links:** Ensuring there are no dead links on your site by using 301 redirects.
    * *Consequence:* Search engine bots get "stuck" when crawling, wasting your crawl budget.

## 3. What is a Technical SEO Audit?
A Technical SEO Audit is a "health checkup" for your website. It is the process of using software to scan your entire website for technical bugs, structural issues, and broken links that are stopping your site from ranking. 

## 4. Best Tools for a Technical SEO Audit
*   **Google Search Console (Free):** Excellent for finding indexing errors directly reported by Google.
*   **Google PageSpeed Insights (Free):** The official tool to test site speed and "Core Web Vitals."
*   **Screaming Frog SEO Spider (Freemium):** The industry standard crawler. It acts like a search engine bot and checks your site for broken links, missing tags, and canonical issues. *(Note: The free version limits you to crawling 500 URLs, which is perfect for beginners and smaller sites).*
*   **Ahrefs / SEMrush Site Audit (Paid):** Premium tools that run a complete technical scan and give your website an overall "Health Score" out of 100.

## 5. Fixing Technical SEO with AI
Technical details and complex audit reports can be overwhelming. Instead of getting confused, you can use AI to understand and fix the exact errors your audit tools give you.

### The AI Prompt for Solving Technical Audit Errors
Run your site through Google PageSpeed Insights or Ahrefs. If you see an error you don't understand, copy the error and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini along with this prompt:
