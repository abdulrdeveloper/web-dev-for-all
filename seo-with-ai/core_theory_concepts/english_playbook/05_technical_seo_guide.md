# What is Technical SEO? — Complete Guide

---

## 1. What is Technical SEO?

Technical SEO means improving the backend and server settings of your website so search engine bots can easily **crawl** (read) and **index** (save) your site.

> **Simple Analogy:**
> The *On-Page SEO* of a car is its beautiful body and paint job — but *Technical SEO* is the **Engine**. If the engine is broken, it doesn't matter how beautiful the car looks from the outside, it won't move forward.

## 2. The 10-Point Technical SEO Checklist

An expert focuses on these 10 technical issues. For each point, let's understand what happens if it is NOT fixed, and how to check it.

---

### 1. XML Sitemap
**What it is:** A map created specifically for search engine crawlers to tell them what pages exist on the website and where to find them.

**If NOT fixed:** Google has to find new pages on its own — many pages might never get indexed.

**How to check:** Type this in your browser:
```
yoursite.com/sitemap.xml
```
Also, go to Google Search Console and submit your sitemap there.

---

### 2. HTML Sitemap
**What it is:** A sitemap for *users* (humans) — it shows the entire structure of the website in one place to make navigation easy.

**If NOT fixed:** Visitors get confused on large websites and might miss important pages.

**Fix:** Create a simple page linked in your footer that lists all categories and main pages.

---

### 3. Robots.txt *(Very Important)*
**What it is:** A small text file that tells Google bots which content they are allowed to crawl and which to ignore.

**If set incorrectly:** Important pages might get blocked, or private pages might get indexed — both are bad situations.

**How to check:** Type this in your browser:
```
yoursite.com/robots.txt
```
If you see the file, it's working. It should look something like this:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/
```

---

### 4. Web Page Speed Optimization *(High Priority)*
**What it is:** Reducing the time it takes for each page to load. This involves compressing images, removing unnecessary scripts, and enabling browser caching.

**If NOT fixed:** Slow website = Higher bounce rate. Google directly drops rankings for slow sites.

**How to check:** Enter your URL on Google PageSpeed Insights:
```
pagespeed.web.dev
```
Aim for a score of **90+**.

---

### 5. Mobile Friendly (Responsive Design) *(High Priority)*
**What it is:** The website must display correctly and be easy to use on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

**If NOT fixed:** Google now uses **Mobile-First Indexing**. If the mobile version is bad, your overall ranking will tank.

**How to check:**
```
search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly
```

---

### 6. Proper Structured Website
**What it is:** The website code, UI/UX, and navigation must be logical and clean. Following **Schema.org structured data** standards.

**If NOT fixed:** Unstructured code slows down crawling. You also lose the chance to get Rich Snippets (stars, prices, FAQs in search results).

**Fix:** Add schema markup to your pages. Use Google's Rich Results Test:
```
search.google.com/test/rich-results
```

---

### 7. HTTPS / SSL Security *(High Priority)*
**What it is:** Securing your website — the URL must have `https://`. An SSL certificate needs to be installed.

**If NOT fixed:** Google considers HTTPS a direct ranking signal. Browsers will show a "Not Secure" warning to users, causing them to lose trust and bounce.

**How to check:** Look at your website URL in the browser — it should have `https://` and a padlock icon.

---

### 8. Canonical Tag
**What it is:** An HTML tag that tells Google which version of a page is the "original" if identical content exists on multiple URLs.

**If NOT fixed:** Creates a Duplicate Content issue. Google gets confused about which page to rank, and link authority gets split between the pages.

**Example:**
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://yoursite.com/original-page/" />
```

---

### 9. Redirection Issues (404 Errors)
**What it is:** Forwarding broken links (404 pages) to the correct pages. When an old URL is deleted, redirecting it to a new one.

**If NOT fixed:** Both users and bots land on a "Page Not Found" error — ruining user experience and dropping site authority in Google's eyes.

**Fix:** Add 301 redirects to old URLs:
```
Redirect 301 /old-page/ https://yoursite.com/new-page/
```
Regularly check the "Coverage" section in Google Search Console for new 404 errors.

---

### 10. Website Hosting / Server Optimization
**What it is:** Fixing performance issues related to your hosting or server — reducing Time to First Byte (TTFB) and ensuring reliable uptime.

**If NOT fixed:** Slow server = slow website, no matter how optimized your code is. If the site is frequently down, Google will drop your ranking.

**How to check:** Server TTFB should be **under 200ms**. You can check this on GTmetrix or WebPageTest.

---

## 3. BONUS: Core Web Vitals *(Google's Direct Ranking Factor)*

It's not just page speed anymore — Google measures three specific metrics that directly affect rankings:

| Metric | What it Measures | Target Score |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | How fast the largest element on the page loads | < 2.5 seconds |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | How much elements shift around while loading | < 0.1 |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | How fast the page responds after a click/tap | < 200ms |

> Check your Core Web Vitals at **pagespeed.web.dev** or in the "Core Web Vitals" section of Google Search Console.
